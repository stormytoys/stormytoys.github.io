<h1 id="start">Start</h1>

<p>As the milker will be a project over many weeks decided to create a project log site with the aim of documenting progress and getting the word out there.
As I make progress on the site I will post updates hopefully on a weekly bases explaining where I am with things. Hopefully this will attract some attention from the community at large, and that hopefully means maybe getting some people on board with specific skills sets.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>For the milker I have decided to go with a vacuum type miler in a similar way of how a cow milking machine works. With one key difference to most DIY machines which is the pulsator will be electronically controlled.
meaning that the stroke length and speed can be varied on the fly achieving patterns rather than simple speed control. I will also be investigating making the vacuum strength variable by electronic means as well.</p>

<p>How a this type of machine is best explained with the image shown below:
<img src="/images/start/inflsc.jpg" alt="Milker" /></p>

<h2 id="pulsator">Pulsator</h2>

<p>For the pulsator I have gone with the following <a href="/images/start/valve.jpg">Solenoid Valve</a>. The valve it self is 3 way where I can expose the service end to either vacuum when open or normal air pressure when closed.
As the valve is electronically controlled I can vary the time between vacuum and normal air pressure through a programmed pattern rather than speed control.</p>

<h2 id="control">Control</h2>

<p>So for the control going with a predictable Arduino with an avr chip. Although this may change in the future depending on what features I want say Bluetooth lte or wifi.
For the moment going to be going with the commands sent over serial saved in to the micro controller for execution <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkWithoutDelay">without using any delay code</a>.</p>

<p>I do have some code for this however I either have a broken Arduino, Broken usb port on computer or Windows 10 is a bit funny. So going to try it on a alternative computer with linux goodness and get back to you on the code it self.
In theory the code works well compiles so that is the first hurdle. Next hurdle is debugging fun when its on a MCU.</p>

<h2 id="milker-receiver">Milker Receiver</h2>

<p>So not decided on what I am doing with this yet. The two options so far are get a serious kit <a href="http://www.seriouskit.com/">SPT</a> or get/build my own.
I have sent an email to serious kit although got no reply as of this post. Although if I do go with DIY/get one built I would have no issues/guilt on releasing something commercial in the future.
For the moment I will cross that bridge at a later date as there is a lot more I can be getting on with before that stage.</p>

<h2 id="help-which-would-be-nice">Help which would be nice</h2>

<p>In short the help I am most likely going to need at the moment is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Figuring out a way of controlling vacumme strengh electronically. Anyone got any experiance/ideas feel fee to contact me</p></li>

<li><p>Milker Receiver as I not got the means to build a nice one at the moment and would love an aesthetically pleasing receiver.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However I would certainly expect there are things I havent even thought off.</p>

<p>My method of contact at the moment is through my <a href="https://fetlife.com/users/1357083">profile</a></p>
